# Data_Science_FreshRetailNet_project
Full data science project: retail demand forecasting, feature engineering, baseline and advanced ML models.


# Data Science FreshRetailNet Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive retail demand forecasting system built using Python, designed to analyze hourly sales data, handle stockouts, incorporate external factors like weather and promotions, and provide actionable insights for business operations. The project follows a production-ready structure with clear separation of data processing, modeling, evaluation, and configuration.

## Features and Capabilities

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load and summarize training and evaluation datasets.
- Analyze distributions of `sale_amount` (mean, median, std, skewness).
- Visualize zero-sales proportion and implications for forecasting.
- Identify temporal patterns (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly trends).
- Analyze stockout effects (censored demand).

### 2. Baseline Models
- **Naive Models**
  - Simple Naive: last observed value.
  - Seasonal Naive: same hour last week.
  - Moving Average: weighted averages with multiple windows.
- **Linear Regression**
  - Temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) with cyclical encoding.
  - Lag features for 1, 7, 168 hours.
  - Feature scaling and validation.
- **Tree-Based Models**
  - Random Forest & XGBoost regression baselines.
  - Handles high-dimensional sparse data.
  - Ensures non-negative predictions.
- **Ensemble Regression**
  - Combines predictions from multiple models.
  - Improved stability and performance.

### 3. Advanced Feature Engineering
- Multi-scale seasonality: intra-day, weekly, monthly patterns.
- Holiday and event features: pre/post holiday impact, school calendar effects.
- Lag and rolling features with multiple horizons (short, medium, long-term).
- Exponentially weighted rolling statistics.
- Weather features: temperature, precipitation, and interaction effects.
- Promotional features: discount categories, changes, and interactions.
- Store and product characteristics: size, performance, popularity, lifecycle.
- Cross-product and hierarchical features: market basket effects, category hierarchies, cannibalization indicators.

### 4. Evaluation Framework
- Core metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Bias.
- Business-relevant metrics: high vs low volume products, peak vs off-peak hours, stockout vs in-stock periods.
- Comparative evaluation across all baseline models.
- Residual analysis and systematic bias detection.
- Insightful reports highlighting model strengths and weaknesses.

## Configuration
- All paths, model hyperparameters, and feature engineering settings are defined in `config/config.yaml`.
- Centralized configuration allows easy switching between models, data subsets, and parameters without changing code.
